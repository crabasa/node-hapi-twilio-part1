# Building a Node app using the Hapi web framework (Part 1)

This is the source code repository for [Part 1][1] of my Nettuts+ blog post series on building a Node web app using the Hapi web framework. In Part 1 we work our way through the following tasks:

* Create a Node web app
* Add the Hapi web framework
* Build a route to return some XML
* Use Twilio to route incoming text messages to our app
* Secure the URL to only accept requests from Twilio
